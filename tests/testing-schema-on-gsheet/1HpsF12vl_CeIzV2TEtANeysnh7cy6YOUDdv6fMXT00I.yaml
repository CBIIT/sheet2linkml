          the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique
          per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will
          likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system
          specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business
          identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured
          in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially
          or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is
          created in a system.

          also be considered to be a business identifier, and should be transmissible

          the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional
          metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that
          created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances
          to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able
